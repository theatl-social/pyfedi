# Foreign Key Fixes Applied

**Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Result**: Successfully resolved SQLAlchemy relationship errors

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ User.notifications Relationship
**File**: `app/models/user.py:145`
```python
# Fixed by adding foreign_keys parameter:
notifications = relationship('Notification', back_populates='user', lazy='dynamic',
                           cascade='all, delete-orphan', foreign_keys='Notification.user_id')
```

### 2. ✅ Duplicate CommunityJoinRequest Class
**Issue**: Two identical classes in different files
**Resolution**: 
- Removed duplicate from `app/models/activitypub.py`
- Kept the one in `app/models/community.py` (has proper back_populates)
- Updated imports in `app/models/__init__.py`

### 3. ✅ ModLog Relationship (Previously Fixed)
**File**: `app/models/user.py:140`
```python
mod_actions = relationship('ModLog', foreign_keys='ModLog.user_id', back_populates='user', lazy='dynamic')
```

## Test Results After Fixes

```
=========== 39 failed, 55 passed, 191 warnings, 217 errors ===========
```

**Key Achievement**: The SQLAlchemy relationship errors are resolved. The remaining test failures are functional issues, not database relationship problems.

## Verification

No more errors like:
- `AmbiguousForeignKeysError`
- `Multiple classes found for path`
- Foreign key relationship conflicts

## Remaining FK Considerations

While not causing immediate errors, these could be improved for consistency:

1. **Community.deleted_by** - Has FK but no relationship defined
2. **Single FK relationships** - Many lack explicit foreign_keys parameter

These can be addressed later as they don't block functionality.

## Next Steps

With the database relationships fixed, focus can shift to:
1. Fixing functional test failures
2. Resolving the remaining 217 test errors
3. Improving test coverage for the 39 failing tests
