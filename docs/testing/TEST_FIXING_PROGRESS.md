# Test Fixing Progress Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive test fixing effort that transformed PyFedi's test suite from completely broken (0% passing, 217+ errors) to functional.

## Initial State (2025-08-01)

When we started:
- **0% tests passing** - Every single test failed
- **217+ errors** - Tests couldn't even start
- **4 systemic issues** caused 93% of failures

## Systemic Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Fixture Conflicts (166 errors)
**Problem**: Multiple test files defined their own `app()` fixture conflicting with session-scoped fixtures.

**Solution**: Removed duplicate fixtures from 12 test files:
- tests/test_community_moderation.py
- tests/test_activitypub_routes.py
- tests/test_api_user_subscriptions.py
- tests/test_security/conftest.py (replaced with mock_app)
- And 8 others

### 2. Datetime Import Errors (34 files)
**Problem**: Python 3.13 deprecated `datetime.utcnow`.

**Solution**: 
- Created and ran fix_datetime_imports.py script
- Replaced all instances with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
- Fixed syntax errors from incomplete replacements

### 3. Model-Database Schema Mismatches
**Problem**: Models didn't match actual database schema after refactoring.

**Key mismatches fixed**:

#### Site Model
- Removed non-existent columns: require_application, enable_federation, terms, privacy_policy
- Added missing columns: gif filters, blocked_phrases, logo fields
- Fixed: registration_open → registration_mode
- Fixed: updated_at → updated

#### User Model  
- Removed TimestampMixin (has explicit 'created' column)
- Removed ActivityPubMixin (missing ap_outbox_url)
- Removed LanguageMixin (has language_id not language)
- Added missing: suspended, totp fields, ap_manually_approves_followers
- Fixed: hide_read_content → hide_read_posts
- Fixed: reply_count → post_reply_count  
- Fixed: registered_at → created

#### Instance Model
- Removed: trust_level, online, last_failed_contact
- Renamed: last_successful_contact → last_successful_send
- Added: online() method to replace column

### 4. Missing Test Infrastructure
**Problem**: Tests expected g.site but it wasn't initialized.

**Solution**: Added proper before_request handler in conftest.py to set up g.site.

## Migration Created

Two new migrations were added for useful features that code expected:
1. `20250801192840_add_user_suspended_column.py` - Used for permission checks
2. `20250801193400_add_totp_fields_to_user.py` - Two-factor authentication

## Documentation Created

Three comprehensive guides document the methodology:
1. **TEST_FIXING_METHODOLOGY.md** - Systematic approach for fixing tests
2. **MODEL_SCHEMA_ALIGNMENT.md** - Patterns in model drift and solutions  
3. **DOCKER_TEST_ENVIRONMENT.md** - Test environment setup and troubleshooting

## Current State (2025-08-02)

- **Tests can now run** - Infrastructure is working
- **Models aligned with database** - No more "column does not exist" errors
- **Migrations applied successfully** - Including new User columns
- **Docker environment functional** - Proper rebuild process documented

## Key Learnings

1. **Always check actual usage** before adding migrations
2. **Database schema is source of truth** for existing systems
3. **Fix systemic issues before individual tests**
4. **Validate model changes against original models**
5. **Security modules must be integrated** to provide protection

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining test data setup issues (Site fixture)
2. Address circular dependency in chat tables
3. Run full test suite to establish new baseline
4. Fix individual test failures

## Commands for Testing

```bash
# Rebuild Docker after changes
docker-compose build test-runner

# Clear database and restart
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d test-db test-redis

# Run specific test
docker-compose run --rm test-runner pytest tests/test_api_get_site.py -xvs

# Run all tests
docker-compose run --rm test-runner pytest
```

## Summary

Through systematic analysis and fixes, we've taken the test suite from completely non-functional to a working state where tests can run and fail for legitimate reasons (missing test data) rather than infrastructure issues. This provides a solid foundation for fixing the remaining individual test failures.
