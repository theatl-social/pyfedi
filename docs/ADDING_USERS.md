# Adding users

There are two ways of adding users to your instance to get the ball rolling.

## Notes before starting

Please note that both of these involve **local** users, and not **remote** users.

## Instructions

### Allow registration

To allow registration:

1. Login to your instance as your admin user
2. Go to **Admin**
3. Click on **Misc settings**
4. Look for **Registration mode**. 
5. Either set the choice to **Open** or **Require Application** 

### Registering

After registration is set to open/require application, the common user flow is to 
navigate to your instance and click **Register**.

## Admin screen

1. Login to your instance as your admin user
2. Go to **Admin**
3. Click **Users**
4. Click the **Add local user** button. 
5. Fill in the details 
6. Ensure you click **Email address is verified**. 

Once you've set all the details and save, the user is now accessible.
