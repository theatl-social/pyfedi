Reporting a vulnerability
-------------------------

If you think you have found a security issue, please send an email to contact@piefed.social.

You should not report such issues in public spaces such as Codeberg issues, chatrooms or PieFed communities
in order to give us time to publish a fix for the issue without exposing PieFed's users to increased risk.

We will review your report and respond within 48 hours.
