# Redis Migration Summary

## Changes Made (2025-01-28)

### 1. Replaced aioredis with redis-py
- Removed `aioredis~=2.0.0` from requirements.txt
- Updated all synchronous Redis operations to use `redis` from redis-py
- Kept `redis.asyncio` for async operations (scheduler, processor)

### 2. Redis Version Upgrade
- Updated Docker images to use Redis 7 (`redis:7-bookworm`)
- Added Redis 7 optimization features via Redis Functions
- Created `app/federation/redis_functions.py` with optimized operations:
  - Atomic rate limiting with sliding window
  - Batch metric increments
  - Stream trimming with statistics

### 3. Fixed Synchronous Redis Calls
- `app/federation/producer.py`: Converted from async to sync methods
- `app/utils.py`: Removed asyncio wrapper for Redis operations
- `config.py`: Removed legacy CELERY_BROKER_URL configuration
- `app/cli.py`: Updated configuration checks for REDIS_URL

### 4. Redis 7 Features Implemented
- **Redis Functions**: Lua-based atomic operations for rate limiting
- **Pipeline Operations**: Batched Redis commands for better performance
- **Improved Streams**: Using Redis 7's optimized stream handling
- **Connection Pooling**: Proper decode_responses=True for string handling

### 5. Comprehensive ActivityPub Testing
Created `tests/test_activitypub_verbs_comprehensive.py` with tests for all verbs:
- Like/Dislike
- Create (Note/Article)
- Update
- Delete
- Follow/Accept/Reject
- Announce
- Undo (Like/Follow)
- Flag
- Add/Remove
- Block
- Collection handling
- Nested activities
- Error cases

### 6. Docker Compose Updates
- Main `docker-compose.yml`: Already using Redis 7
- `compose.dev.yaml`: Updated from Redis 6.2 to Redis 7
- Replaced Celery container with federation-worker
- Added Redis persistence with AOF (append-only file)

## Benefits of Redis 7

1. **Performance**: Up to 50% better performance for streams
2. **Functions**: Atomic operations without round-trips
3. **ACLs**: Better security (ready for future implementation)
4. **Memory**: Improved memory usage for large datasets
5. **Debugging**: Better introspection tools

## Migration Notes

- All Redis operations are now synchronous in Flask request context
- Async Redis operations remain in background processors
- Redis Functions provide atomic guarantees for rate limiting
- Backwards compatible fallback for Redis 6 if needed
