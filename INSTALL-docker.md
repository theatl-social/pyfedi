### Easy Way: Docker

#### PRE-INSTALL REQUIREMENTS
- Registered domain name for external access
- Require SSL connection (Nginx/Caddy reverse proxy, Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel, Tailscale, Ngrok, etc.)

Note: This guide uses `docker compose`. Depending on your docker setup, you may need to use the command `docker-compose` instead.


#### COPY GITHUB REPOSITORY INTO A NEW DIRECTORY (PYFEDI/)
```bash
git clone https://codeberg.org/rimu/pyfedi.git
cd pyfedi/
git checkout v1.2.x
```

Change the 'git checkout' line to be the latest release. Check the branch name to find what to use after 'checkout' by
going to https://codeberg.org/rimu/pyfedi and then clicking on the 'main' box:

![branch names](https://join.piefed.social/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/branch_names.png)

#### PREPARE DOCKER ENVIRONMENT FILE
```bash
sudo cp env.docker.sample .env.docker
sudo nano .env.docker
```
- `SECRET_KEY='...'` - Replace text with random numbers and letters. Should be at least 32 characters long.
- `SERVER_NAME='...'` - Enter a registered domain name (do **NOT** include `http://`). Use the address `127.0.0.1:8030` for testing or development.
<br>
Note: If your testing/dev instance needs to federate with other instances then you will **need** a domain name. Ngrok.com has a free tier you can use - get this before proceeding because changing the `SERVER_NAME` variable later involves wiping all data and starting again.
- Add additional variables (Mail, Cloudflare, etc.) relevant to your needs. See file `pyfedi/env.sample` for example variables.


#### CHECK COMPOSE.YML
- Check ports (8030:5000) and volume definitions if this is relevant to your needs. If not, skip this step.
```bash
sudo nano compose.yaml
```

If you want to customise compose.yaml it is better to
[make a copy of it named compose.override.yaml](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/multiple-compose-files/merge/#example)
and make your changes in there.

#### CREATE REQUIRED FOLDERS WITH REQUIRED PERMISSIONS

Do **not** skip this. Enter your sudo password when prompted.

```bash
./docker-dirs.sh
```
This will automatically create the following directories with the required permissions to continue:
- pyfedi/pgdata/
- pyfedi/media/
- pyfedi/logs/
- pyfedi/tmp/

#### BUILD PIEFED
```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
sudo docker compose up --build
```
- Wait until text in terminal stops scrolling. Ignore the configuration check errors at this point.
- If you see many permission-related errors, try repeating the previous step (with the chown command using 1000 instead of your username)
- Test external access from browser (On port 8030). Watch for movement in terminal window. Browser will show "Internal Server Error" message. Proceed to initialize database to address this error message.

#### INITIALIZE DATABASE
- Open a new terminal window
```bash
sudo docker exec -it piefed_app1 sh
```

The above command will get you into a shell inside the container. Then, inside that shell run this:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=pyfedi.py
flask init-db
```
- Enter username, email (optional), and password.
- Test external access from browser again. PieFed should now load. Login as admin with the same username and password.
```bash
exit
```
- Close this terminal window

#### SHUT DOWN PIEFED & START AGAIN IN BACKGROUND
- Return to the main terminal window and press `CTRL+C` to temporarily shut down PieFed
- Start PieFed in the background:
```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

- During startup, you might see "Running configuration check..." followed by validation messages. Checkmarks (✅)
indicate successful configuration, warnings (⚠️) are usually fine to ignore, but X marks (❌) indicate critical issues that need fixing.

At this point you have PieFed listening on port 8030. You will need Nginx, etc as a reverse proxy to forward connections
on port 443 to 8030, or a Cloudflare tunnel going to 8030, or wireguard, etc.

#### SETUP CRON (AUTOMATED) JOBS
```bash
sudo nano /etc/cron.d/piefed
```
- Copy & Paste the text below
- Replace `<USERNAME>` with account username
```
5 2 * * * <USERNAME> docker exec piefed_app1 bash -c "cd /app && ./daily.sh"
5 4 * * 1 <USERNAME> docker exec piefed_app1 bash -c "cd /app && ./remove_orphan_files.sh"
1 */6 * * * <USERNAME> docker exec piefed_app1 bash -c "cd /app && ./email_notifs.sh"
*/5 * * * * <USERNAME> docker exec piefed_app1 bash -c "cd /app && ./send_queue.sh"
```

#### UPDATING & RESTARTING PIEFED
Manually:
```bash
cd pyfedi/
sudo git pull
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
sudo docker compose up -d --build
```
Provided script:
```bash
cd pyfedi/
./deploy-docker2.sh
```
NOTE: Major version updates may require extra steps. Check [PieFed Meta](https://piefed.social/c/piefed_meta) for announcements and further instructions.

Run `git update-index --assume-unchanged compose.yaml` to make git ignore your custom compose.yaml and not try to update it if anything changes upstream.

#### VIEW LOGS
```bash
sudo docker logs -f piefed_app1
```
- `-f` Option displays logs with constant updates. Press `CTRL+C` to exit.


### FOR DEVELOPERS

An alternative Compose file improves the developer experience by automatically reloading the application whenever Python or template files change. It also mounts your local files into the container so you don’t have to rebuild or restart on every edit.

Use:
```bash
sudo docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up
```
